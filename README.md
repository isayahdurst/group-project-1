<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Taylor's Kitchen][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

Of all the questions that have ever been asked, one of the oldest and most important must be: "What should I eat today?" For most of human history, people didn't really have much of a choice; they ate what was available to them. But in the modern era that we live in today, we do have a choice of what we eat, and those choices can make a drastic difference on our long-term health.

But bodies are different, and different bodies require different diets. There isn't a "one-size-fits-all" plan for personal nutrition.

<b>We've created the next best thing:</b> a meal plan that's tailored to your specific diet preferences. Our website allows you to customize your diets, cuisines, and food intolerances to your liking to recommend foods and recipes that compliment your tastes and needs.

This application has been built using two different server-side APIs and is a complete front-end solution. Without having access to a back-end, we've leveraged local-storage and third-party data storage solutions to bring this project to life and create something that we found to be challenging, exciting, and useful.

The main contributors to this project are listed as follows:

- Anthony Li
- Frank Nguyen
- Raymond Robinson
- Benjamin Ha
- Isayah Durst

<!-- ROADMAP -->

## Roadmap

- [ ] Allow users to target a specific number of daily calories they would like to consume and tailor their meal plan accordingly.
- [ ] Allow users to search for ingredients they would like to have in their meals or ingredients they would specifically like to exclude.
- [ ] Allow users to add ingredients to a shopping cart and open that shopping card with a grocery delivery service for easy ordering.
  - [ ] Users can edit their pantry to check which items they already have and which items they need to buy.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/isayahdurst/group-project-1/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
